# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives**
# - List of popular languages in Data Science
# - List of commonly used Data Science libraries
# - Tabular list of Data Science tools
# - Evaluating arithmethic expressions in Python

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. Java    
# 3. C++

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. Scientific computing libraries in python (pandas, Numpy)
# 2. Visualization libraries in python (Matplotlib, seaborn)
# 3. High-level-machine learning and deep learning (Scikit, Keras)

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# 

# In[1]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[2]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
200/60
